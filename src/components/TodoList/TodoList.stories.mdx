# TodoList

A `TodoList` is comprised of multiple `Todo` components.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="todolist--single-todo" />
</Canvas>

They are arranged in a list.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="todolist--a-few-todos" />
</Canvas>

When you have more of them than fit on a page, you get a scrolling effect.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="todolist--many-todos" />
</Canvas>

Of course, no one likes seeing that much work left to be done! ðŸ˜…
